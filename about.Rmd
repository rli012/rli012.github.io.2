
I'm a Bioinformatics Research Scientist at [Gilead Sciences, Inc.](https://www.gilead.com/) in the Bay Area in California, USA. Before joining Gilead, I studied in the [Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics (GGB) Program](https://ggb.ucr.edu/) at [Univeristy of California, Riverside (UCR)](https://www.ucr.edu/) for the Ph.D. degree of Bioinformatics (2013-2018) and in the [Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](http://www.genetics.ac.cn/) for my master's degree of Genetics (2010-2013).

I love open source and I am very happy to be collaborating with biologists on exciting projects. If you have any questions or would like to have more discussions, please feel free to email me at rli012@ucr.edu or add my wechat: li-rui-dong, although the response may not be prompt.
