Before joining Gilead, I studied in the <a href="https://ggb.ucr.edu/">Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics (GGB) Program</a> at <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/">Univeristy of California, Riverside (UCR)</a> for the Ph.D. degree of Bioinformatics (2013-2018) and in the <a href="http://www.genetics.ac.cn/">Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)</a> for my master’s degree of Genetics (2010-2013).</p>
<p>I love open source and I am very happy to be collaborating with biologists on exciting projects. If you have any questions or would like to have more discussions, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:rli012@ucr.edu">rli012@ucr.edu</a> or add my wechat: li-rui-dong, although the response may not be prompt.</p>
